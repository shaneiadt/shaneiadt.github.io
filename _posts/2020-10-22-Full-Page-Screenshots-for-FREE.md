Fed up looking for an extension, app or something just to take a ruddy full page screen shot without breaking the bank?

Well have I got a something super cool for you & it's totally **FREE** :smile:

1) Open **Chrome** > **DevTools**

2) Hit the three dots & click on "**Run Command**" (`Ctrl + Shift + P`)

3) Type in "**Screenshot**" and select the "**Capture full size screenshot**"

4) It should only take a few seconds & it will auto download to your machine

5) Enjoy :sunglasses:
