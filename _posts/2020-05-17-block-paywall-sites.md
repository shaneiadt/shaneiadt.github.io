The internet is an amazing resource with some paid & free content. The only problem here is we don't get to decide when we want to see the free content over the paid stuff. Search engines are run by companies and aim to increase their profits ever year so we can't really blame them....can't we? :triumph:

If you're fed up with paywall sites clogging up your search results, you might like to try out this little number :smiling_imp:
