From some very smart people behind [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) & [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/) comes a new web framework "**Astro**". It's still in beta at the moment but you can join their discord and sign-up for [early access](https://astro.build/).

As it's still in closed beta all we have is this great [Speakeasy Js](https://speakeasyjs.com/) [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgkwZqVkrwo).

## What's interesting about this new thing?

It's upfront and honest there is no re-inventing of wheels more a borrowing old tech ideas sprinkled with some magic...because we all know magic is real & technology is pure magic :smile:

Here's some cool aspects of **Astro**:

- Bring Your Own Framework (BYOF) gives you the ability to combine components from different libraries together and even share state! Be it `.vue`, `.jsx` or `.svelte` you can use it all under one roof....let's not forget web components too.
- SCSS out of the box, simply add a `lang="scss"` attribute to your style tag and away you trot.
- It provides a file based routing system.
- No need for CSS modules as all styles will be scoped by default to the component they're defined in.
- This is a big one....it ships with **NO JAVASCRIPT**! JS component bundles are added on an opt-in basis with some cool ways to lazy-load.
- It brings components directly into your markdown files akin to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

Definitely worth checking out and expect it to be hitting the shelves sometime in the near future :muscle:
